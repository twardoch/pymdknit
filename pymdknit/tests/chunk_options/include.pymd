# include code chunk options

Here we have two empty lines, because the ones from markdown are preserved...

```{python include=False}
have_run = True
print("## This will show as a real headline")
```

```{python include=True}
if have_run == True:
    print("'have_run==True': ran the codeblock before this one.")
```
