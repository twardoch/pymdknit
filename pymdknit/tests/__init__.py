    You have to build a TestCase class, with a _output_test(self, input_file, output_file)

    are in.

    The inputs for the test cases have to have a file ending "*_input.pymd" and the outputs have
    to end in "*_output.md".

    The `_output_test` method has to convert input and then test for equality with the output.

    The generated test methods will be called `test_something` for `something_input.pymd`.
